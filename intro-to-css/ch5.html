            <input name="b2" value="button 2" type="button" />

            The first step in understanding how to position elements is to understand the fundamental
            model of CSS—the box model.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The Box Model</h2>
        <p>
            Every element you place on a page creates a box. You cannot always see the boundaries
            and the borders of the boxes you create, but the boxes are there. A <em>div</em>
            element creates a box, as do <em>h1</em>,<em>img</em>, <em>span</em>, and <em>td</em>
            elements. Each box has properties you can set with CSS. I’ve illustrated some of
            these properties in Figure 1.</p>
        <p>

                title=""><br>
            <strong>Figure 1 Border, padding, and margin</strong>
            <div class="clear">
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>padding</em> of a box is the distance between the content of the box and
            the box’s border, and the <em>margin</em> is the distance between a box and any
            adjacent element. In other words, padding adds space inside the border, while a
            margin adds space outside the border. In the following CSS, I set both the padding
            and the margin to a distance of 10 pixels. This is why you can see so much white
            space in Figure 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The border surrounding every element is not visible by default, but by using CSS
            I can change the color of an element’s border, as well as the thickness and line
            style the browser uses when drawing the border. What you see in Figure 1 is the
            result of a style rule telling the browser to draw a solid, thin, red line around
            the box that each div element creates.
